# Botium Toys – Internal Security Audit  
Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate

---

## Overview

This repository contains my internal security audit of **Botium Toys**, a fictional U.S.-based toy company expanding into international e-commerce markets.  

This audit was completed as part of the *Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate* program and focuses on evaluating the organization’s security posture, identifying risks, and assessing regulatory compliance readiness.

---

## Business Scenario

Botium Toys operates from a single physical location that functions as:

- Corporate office  
- Retail storefront  
- Warehouse  

As the company expands its online presence — including customers in the European Union — the IT department faces increased demands related to security, compliance, and business continuity.

The audit was conducted to evaluate whether current controls are sufficient to support secure growth.

## Audit Objectives

The primary objectives of this audit were to:

- Assess existing administrative, technical, and physical controls  
- Identify high-risk vulnerabilities  
- Evaluate compliance exposure (PCI DSS and GDPR)  
- Align findings with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)  
- Provide prioritized security recommendations  

---

## Methodology

The audit followed a structured approach:

1. **Scope Definition** – Identified systems, assets, and regulatory exposure  
2. **Control Assessment** – Reviewed implemented safeguards  
3. **Risk Evaluation** – Determined likelihood and impact of vulnerabilities  
4. **Compliance Mapping** – Mapped findings to PCI DSS, GDPR, and NIST CSF

## Key Assets Identified

### Information Assets
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII)  
- Payment card information  
- Employee records  
- Financial and inventory data

### Infrastructure Assets
- End-user devices  
- Internal network  
- E-commerce platform

## High-Risk Findings

- Absence of a formal incident response plan  
- Potential PCI DSS compliance gaps  
- GDPR regulatory exposure  
- Limited disaster recovery and backup planning  
- Weak enforcement of role-based access control  

---

## Compliance Considerations

### PCI DSS
Required due to online payment processing.  
Focus areas include encryption, access restriction, and ongoing monitoring.

### GDPR
Applicable due to EU customers.  
Requires proper handling of personal data and 72-hour breach notification procedures.

## Key Recommendations

- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)  
- Develop and document an incident response plan  
- Establish encrypted and regularly tested backups  
- Enforce role-based access control (RBAC)  
- Conduct formal PCI DSS compliance assessment  
- Deploy centralized logging and monitoring  

---

## Framework Alignment

This audit aligns with the six core functions of the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**:

- Govern
- Identify  
- Protect  
- Detect  
- Respond  
- Recover  

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Risk assessment and prioritization  
- Security control evaluation  
- Regulatory compliance analysis  
- NIST CSF implementation  
- Professional audit reporting
